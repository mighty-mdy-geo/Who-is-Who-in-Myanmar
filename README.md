    ABSTRACT

This project will present that shows about famous people who lives in Myanmar. Users can get easily information on their fingertips. Who is Who in Myanmar is a type of only information page that helps to provide the details information of famous people in Myanmar. They have special features like unusual standard of living or special skills that are not found in common people. It can be said that in society that they are different from the common people. Among of them, this project shows such as Politician ( Eg: Daw Aung San Suu Kyi), Business Leader (Eg: U Khin Shwe), Celebrity (Eg: Hlwan Paing).

** ** To form our app design, we had to take some templates such as Material Design Lite (MDL) and Materialize CSS. And then coding and design were merged into a useful app.

** ** The part of documentation is to show how our app had worked step by steps. Finally,Who is Who in Myanmar is released as a link for users to be used easily.

Project Details
Project Title 	Who is Who in Myanmar
Project ID 	GMIT Company Internship


1.1 Introduction

    Nowadays, mobile phones are very useful for everyone to communicate with each other. No long distance charges have applications like games and calendar to help organize schedules. Not only adults but also children use mobile phones. So they are becoming an important part of our everyday life. Nowadays, reducing the men&#39;s physical effort with the help of latest devices and technologies is on demand. Besides, it is easier to find information and facts on the Internet than to find information using newspapers, journals etc.

    Everyone has at least one idol. We can find easily about the famous people who we want to know in this app. This is divided into three parts. They are Politician, Business Leader and Celebrity.

    The project named &quot;Who is Who in Myanmar&quot; is aimed to find information about the famous people who you want to find. You can easily search birth date, address, occupation and biography etc.., in this app.

    Our project is implemented by Python with Flask framework.


1.2 Background of the System

We use Git-Hub as a version control system to get good communication between designers and developers. We use SQL Alchemy as a Python SQLite toolkit to get the full power and flexibility of SQLite. Our Web Application is implemented by using web design development frameworks, Python, Flask, SQL Alchemy and Heroku.
Web design development frameworks are as follows:

    HTML
    CSS
    JAVASCRIPT
    MATERIALIZE CSS
    MATERIAL DESIGN LITE


1.2.1** HTML**

    HTML – Hyper Text Markup Language – is the language for website creators creating web pages. Strictly speaking, it&#39;s not the only language webmasters should know – far from it – but definitely the most important one. Without knowing it (or XHTML, its variation) nobody can create as much as one webpage looking even slightly prettier than a page of unformatted plain text. The WWW as we know it would never exist without the invention of HTML.

1.2.2 CSS

    **C** ascading **S** tyle **S** heets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.CSS is easy to learn and understand but it provides powerful control over the presentation of an HTML document. Most commonly, CSS is combined with the markup languages HTML or XHTML.

1.2.3 JAVA SCRIPT

    Java Script (JS) is a scripting languages, primarily used on the Web. It is used to enhance HTML pages and is commonly found embedded in HTML code. JavaScript is an interpreted language. Thus, it doesn&#39;t need to be compiled. JavaScript renders web pages in an interactive and dynamic fashion. This allowing the pages to react to events, exhibit special effects, accept variable text, validate data, create cookies, detect a user&#39;s browser, etc.

1.2.4 MATERIALIZE CSS

** ** Materialize is basically a CSS framework which is used to create responsive websites. Materialize framework is basically built on Google's material design concept. Materialize framework is created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, Anyone having the basic knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript can learn easily. Materialize provides you ready made rich layouts, animations and many more powerful UI.

1.2.5 MATERIAL DESIGN LITE

** ** Material Design Lite is built to provide a lightweight and basic set of Material Design components and templates for web sites. The project does not intend to provide structures to create all possible UX needs, but to provide a low-friction Material Design implementation you can build on.

1.2.6 PYTHON

    Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python&#39;s simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

1.2.7 FLASK

** ** Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a micro framework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. Applications that use the Flask framework include Pinterest, LinkedIn, and the community web page for Flask itself.

	1.2.8 SQL ALCHEMY

** ** SQL Alchemy is the Python SQLite toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQLite. It provides a full suite of well-known enterprise-level persistence patterns, designed for efficient and high-performing database access.

1.2.9 GIT - HUB

** ** Git-Hub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere. It is simply a software that helps you manage your source code. That means each change that you make to a source code is recorded in its history. So it can also be called as Source Code management system.

1.2.10 HEROKU

** ** Heroku is a cloud platform that lets companies build, deliver, monitor and scale apps — we're the fastest way to go from idea to URL, bypassing all those infrastructure headaches.

1.3 Objectives of the Project

• To search easily and quickly the user's desire data.

• To know the actions and steps of famous person.

• To learn about the famous person.

• To decrease search time.

• To help the people who want to know the details of Myanmar famous people.

• To acquire knowledge.

CHAPTER 2

METHDOLOGY

** 2.1 Requirement Analysis**

The description of the services and constraints are the requirements for the system. Requirement Analysis is the process of deriving the system requirements through observation of existing system. We get all information of data we use in this project from Wikipedia.

2.2 Software Selection

Chosen Programming Language

I would like to use Python as a programming language by using Flask framework in my project because Python is a favorite among many developers for its strong emphasis on readability and efficiency, especially when compared to other languages like Java, PHP, or C++.

    Python is Easy to learn.
    Python lets you build more function with fewer lines of code.
    Python provides a stepping stone to learning other code.
    Python is perfect for building prototypes.
    Python web development is flexible, there are several robust python implementations integrated with other programming languages.
    Low cost web development tools.
    Python is open source platform built by thousands of contributes from all corners of the world.

2.3 Software Requirements

    Vim
    Pycharm
    Heroku
    Python with Flask
    Git Hub

2.4 Hardware Requirements

    Personal Computer
    Mobile Phone
    Internet Access
